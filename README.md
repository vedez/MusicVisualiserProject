## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
Our team has chosen "Enemy by Imagine Dragons and JID" for our Music Visualiser Project. 
In order to achieve a neater and organised display - we will separate the background instrumental and voicetrack of the song into three different visualisers by using the different levels of frequencies of each element as well as using the user's default screen size as the full display of the application. 
Art assets and the colour palette used are in relation to the song in itself. It is a song based on a TV series - Arcane - inspired from a well known e-Sport game by Riot, League of Legends. 

Other elements added into the application are;
- Volume (Up and Down arrow keys)
- Pause/Play Buttom (Spacebar key)
- Bar Timeline in which lets the user know the length of the song and what part of the song they are in.
- Star Visual Background (An animated background)

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
